# NAOMI

I finally realized I needed to up and share my SH4 / NAOMI documentation, maybe this way some traction will appear and maybe I'll even find msyefl more interested in it again.

What is in here? most documents (I will be constantly uploading more documents as I dig them over the ridiculous amount of information and code I have lying around and pictures.

Any requests .. add a ticket? :)
